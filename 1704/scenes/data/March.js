At their rendezvous point, the Natives replaced many captives\' <a href="javascript:openLink(\'artifacts\',\'shoe\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>shoes</u></font></a> with heavy wrap-around winter <a href="javascript:openLink(\'artifacts\',\'moccasins\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>moccasins</u></font></a> to make walking in snow easier. From a low bluff just north of Deerfield, they could see the burning town behind them.</p><br><p><b>Retreat:</b> Militiamen from nearby towns rode to Deerfield\'s aid upon seeing smoke in the morning sky, but retreated to the <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'palisade\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>palisade</u></font></a> after a well-coordinated assault by the allies\' rear guard killed nine more Englishmen. These deaths brought the total number of <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'English\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>English</u></font></a> killed to 50; five allies died in this fight, bringing their total dead to 11. </p><br><p><b>Urgent flight:</b> The Native and French allies hastened to keep their dazed captives moving as quickly as possible. Weary from the 3 1/2 hour battle and carrying their wounded comrades, they pushed to stay ahead of their pursuers and survive the trek through winter forests with limited food supplies. The raiding party warned their captives that all would be killed if the party were pursued, but otherwise they would not be harmed. The captives moved slowly, struggling to walk without <a href="javascript:openLink(\'artifacts\',\'snowshoes\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>snowshoes</u></font></a> through deep, wet snow, covering only 20 miles in the first three days. Captors began killing the grievously injured and those who could not keep up the grueling pace.</p><br><p>Why did the allies take so many captives, and was the killing of some captives merciful or expedient? </p><br>';
  tabTexts["Wobanakiak"] = '<p><b>A wealth of captives:</b> As the raiders readied their captives for the march, two <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Wobanakiak\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>W\u00F4banakiak</u></font></a> guarded Deerfield\'s minister, the Reverend <a href="javascript:openLink(\'people\',\'JohnWilliams\',\'March\')"><font color="#660000"><u>John Williams</u></font></a>, knowing that he was a leader who could be expected to fetch a good ransom. <a href="javascript:openLink(\'people\',\'Wattanummon\',\'March\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Wattanummon</u></font></a>, a <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Pennacook\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Pennacook</u></font></a>&#032;&#032;<a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'sachem\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>sachem</u></font></a>, took charge of John\'s son <a href="javascript:openLink(\'people\',\'StephenWilliams\',\'March\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Stephen</u></font></a>. As a child, Stephen was a potential candidate for adoption into Wattanummon\'s family, some of whom had recently been killed by the <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'English\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>English</u></font></a>. The W\u00F4banakiak made up a large part of the raiding party and had claimed many captives.  Once they reached W\u00F4banaki villages, captives might be chosen for adoption, put to work as slaves, sold to the French or sold back to the English for ransom. The greatest challenge lay in keeping these captives alive during the difficult winter march.</p><br><p><b>Successful alliances</b>: The success of the attack on Deerfield was a direct result of the recent alliance the W\u00F4banakiak enjoyed with the French and Native signatories of the Great Peace of 1701. The Pennacook\'s request to <a href="javascript:openLink(\'artifacts\',\'vaudreuil_portrait\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Governor Vaudreuil</u></font></a> of <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'New_France\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>New France</u></font></a> for help in a raid against the English had been honored. </p><br><p><b>Destinations:</b> As the allies headed north, the W\u00F4banakiak planned to rejoin their kin at <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Cowass\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Cowass</u></font></a>, <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'missisquoi\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Missisquoi</u></font></a>, <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'St_Francis\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>St. Francis</u></font></a>, and other villages located throughout their homelands. The Pennacook party headed toward their usual winter hunting territory, traveling familiar trails. The journey that seemed such an ordeal to the English was not\u2014except for the burden of the captives\u2014an unusual hardship for the W\u00F4banakiak, who were well-used to foot travel in all seasons.</p><br>';
  tabTexts["English"] = '<p><b>Shock:</b> The Deerfield captives, taken from their homes that they saw set afire, now faced a grueling journey through unknown terrain with enemies they feared as savages. Driven by their captors up wooded hills north of the town, they saw below them \u0022the smoke of the fires in the town, and beheld the awful desolations of Deerfield.\u0022 <a href="javascript:openLink(\'footnotes\',\'March\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>(1)</u></font></a></p><br><p><b>Pursuit?</b> In the village, more <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Militiamen\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>militiamen</u></font></a> from towns to the south arrived. After some debate, they decided not to pursue the raiding party, out of fear that the allies would respond by killing the captives\u2014especially the Williams family. Their lack of <a href="javascript:openLink(\'artifacts\',\'JSsnowshoes\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>snowshoes</u></font></a>, too, would hinder their travel, and they feared another ambush at the hands of the <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'French\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>French</u></font></a> and Native fighters.</p><br><p><b>Fear, dread, and faith:</b> The captives were horrified by the killings of women and children who could not keep pace, which they saw as cruel and bloodthirsty. Struggling to walk without snowshoes through the deep, wet snow, they feared the same fate for themselves and family members who were weakening. As 10-year-old <a href="javascript:openLink(\'people\',\'StephenWilliams\',\'March\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Stephen Williams</u></font></a> later wrote, \u0022my feet were very sore so that I was afraid they would kill me also.\u0022 <a href="javascript:openLink(\'footnotes\',\'March\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>(2)</u></font></a> The captives\' only comfort was their strong <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Protestant\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Protestant</u></font></a> faith. Facing death, <a href="javascript:openLink(\'people\',\'EuniceMWilliams\',\'March\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Mrs. Eunice Williams</u></font></a> and others declared themselves ready to accept God\'s will. They were grateful that their Native masters let them read Scripture and allowed the Reverend <a href="javascript:openLink(\'people\',\'JohnWilliams\',\'March\')"><font color="#660000"><u>John Williams</u></font></a> to preach on the Sabbath. They feared that the French would tempt them to convert to <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Catholicism\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Catholicism</u></font></a>, which they loathed as superstitious \u0022<a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Popery\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>popery</u></font></a>.\u0022 Although the English themselves allied with Native peoples whenever possible, they loudly condemned the French\u2014traditional rivals, though fellow Europeans\u2014for recruiting Indian \u0022savages\u0022 to attack English colonists.</p><br>';
  tabTexts["French"] = '<p><b>Costly success:</b> Marching north, the French <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Militiamen\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>militiamen</u></font></a> and regular officers were somber. The raid had been a success: the town was devastated, and <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'New_France\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>New France</u></font></a> had shown the <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Wobanakiak\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>W\u00F4banakiak</u></font></a> and other Native nations that it was a reliable ally. But <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'French\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>French</u></font></a> casualties were high. Nearly half of the 48 French raiders had been wounded in the attack, including their leader, <a href="javascript:openLink(\'people\',\'Hertel\',\'March\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Jean-Baptiste Hertel de Rouville</u></font></a>. Three had been killed.</p><br><p><b>Flight:</b> Anticipating <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'English\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>English</u></font></a> pursuit, De Rouville pushed the group at a swift and difficult pace and put guards at the front and rear of the column. They needed to reach New France before they ran out of food\u2014or get far enough north to find their food caches and hunt. De Rouville may also have thought that a rapid pace would keep the disparate expedition members focused on a common goal. The large number of captives slowed them down more than expected. </p><br><p><b>French captives:</b> In joint expeditions with Native allies, the French usually left control of captives to Native warriors, for whom they were the spoils of war. In Deerfield, though, the raiders found three French fur traders, including Jacques de Noyon who had married into Deerfield\'s Stebbins family. De Rouville took the renegades and probably the Stebbins family to New France in his custody. De Rouville and his men were veterans of similar raids, and knew that some captives would be adopted by Native communities and others would be ransomed by French officials or individuals. Some, they hoped, would settle in New France, increasing the colony\'s population. Others would be returned to New England after negotiations with the English authorities, sometimes in exchange for French prisoners held by the English.</p><br>';
  tabTexts["KanienKehaka"] = '<p><b>Mourning war:</b> As the march back to <a href="javascript:openLink(\'maps\',\'northeast\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>New France</u></font></a> began, <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Kanienkehaka\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Kanienkehaka</u></font></a> (Mohawk) warriors carried some young children, including four-year-old Abigail Nims and <a href="javascript:openLink(\'artifacts\',\'moccasins\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u></u></font></a>seven-year-old <a href="javascript:openLink(\'people\',\'EuniceKWilliams\',\'March\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Eunice Williams</u></font></a>. The Kanienkehaka were eager to bring as many captives as possible back to their communities, <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Kahnawake\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Kahnawake</u></font></a>, <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'sault_au_Recollet\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Sault-au-R\u00E9collet</u></font></a>  and <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'La_Montagne\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>La Montagne</u></font></a>. Kanienkehaka warriors helped captive children survive the trek by carrying them on their back\u2014but also knew that those who slowed the group\'s progress would have to be sacrificed. Captives were needed to bolster the Kanienkehaka population and keep their communities strong against their enemies. And children were especially prized as potential adoptees into families. According to a Kanienkehaka family history, a grieving mother who remained inconsolable after her daughter\'s death was one of the women who sent a number of Kahnawake warriors on a \u0022mourning war\u0022 to Deerfield. Through this traditional Kanienkehaka consolation ritual, she hoped to assuage her grief by adopting a captive to replace her daughter. </p><br><p><b>Battle strategy:</b> Kanienkehaka raiding patterns and battle tactics centered around the taking of captives. They avoided taking fortified positions and other battles that were unlikely to result in many captives\u2014a policy that often frustrated their French allies. A warrior\'s success was measured not only by his bravery, but also by his ability to seize captives and bring them home alive. Capturing enemies earned a warrior greater glory than killing them in battle.</p><br><p><b>Causalities:</b> Despite the success of the raid and the abundance of captives, the Kanienkehaka marched without much joy. They had sustained casualties; several Kanienkehaka had been killed or wounded, and replenishing the population was often the motivation for war in the first place.</p><br>';
  tabTexts["Wendat"] = '<p><b>Meadow fight:</b> While the captives were being gathered across the Deerfield River, about thirty <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Wendat\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Wendat</u></font></a> (Huron), <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Wobanakiak\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>W\u00F4banaki</u></font></a>, and French fighters ambushed English <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Militiamen\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>militiamen</u></font></a> from Deerfield and nearby towns. They hid in a line of trees along the river as the English, floundering without <a href="javascript:openLink(\'artifacts\',\'JSsnowshoes\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>snowshoes</u></font></a> in the deep snow, pursued the raiders across the north meadows. When the English neared, the allies leapt up and fired, routing them back to the <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'palisade\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>palisade</u></font></a>.</p><br><p><b>Alliances:</b> Wendat warriors fought bravely to aid the escape of the allies with their captives. As a <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Jesuit\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Jesuit</u></font></a> missionary said, \u0022in the fray they will never . . . yield before the enemy\'s attack.\u0022 <a href="javascript:openLink(\'footnotes\',\'March\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>(3)</u></font></a> Supporting the alliance was of the utmost importance to the Wendats because they were a small community. They established an alliance of <a href="javascript:openLink(\'maps\',\'northeast\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Native villages</u></font></a> along the St. Lawrence River that later became known as the <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Seven_Fires\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Seven Fires Council</u></font></a>. The Wendats joined the raid to support the alliance and for the opportunity to prove their valor in battle.</p><br><p><b>Loss and retribution:</b> Despite the raid\'s success, the small group of Wendat warriors had reason to be dispirited as the march began. Tsawenhohi, their \u0022great chief,\u0022 had been badly wounded attacking the Stebbins house and seemed to be dying. His death would require retribution, which traditionally took the form of torture and death by burning of a captive. As the smallest Native contingent on the march, the Wendats had the fewest number of captives. The Wendats prized captives as emblems of a warrior\'s prowess and as a way to take revenge on their enemies. Captives were often adopted into families. </p><br>';
