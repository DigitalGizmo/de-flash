Weary from the 3 1/2 hour battle and carrying their wounded comrades, they pushed to stay ahead of their pursuers and survive the trek through winter forests with limited food supplies. The raiding party warned their captives that all would be killed if the party were pursued, but otherwise they would not be harmed. The captives moved slowly, struggling to walk without <a href="javascript:openLink(\'artifacts\',\'snowshoes\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>snowshoes</u></font></a> through deep, wet snow, covering only 20 miles in the first three days.

The W\u00F4banakiak made up a large part of the raiding party and had claimed many captives.
