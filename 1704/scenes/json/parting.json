Captive families were separated, each captive going with his or her master.</p><br><p><b>Hard traveling:</b> To get here, the raiders and captives had walked about 140 miles through wet, heavy snow. In the first three days of their journey, they covered only about 20 miles, across wooded hills to a camp on the Connecticut River in <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'Sokwakiak\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>Sokwakiak</u></font></a> territory, where sleds and other supplies were cached. From there, they walked north on the frozen Connecticut for four days, up to their ankles in slush and ice, at a pace of about 20 miles a day. Food was running low, but it was parceled out to be shared by captives and captors alike. Less fit and less used to winter travel than their captors, the captives also lacked <a href="javascript:openLink(\'artifacts\',\'snowshoes\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>snowshoes</u></font></a> and suffered from cut, swollen feet. A number of weakened captives were killed along the way, as were young children if their captors could no longer carry them.</p><br><p><b>Survival:</b> The raiding party felt confident that they were now beyond the reach of <a href="javascript:openLink(\'glossary\',\'English\',\'\')"><font color="#660000"><u>English</u></font></a> pursuers, so they felt free to break into smaller groups and travel at a slower pace. Smaller groups were necessary for hunting, which was now urgently needed to prevent starvation. It would take at least two more weeks to reach their destinations.</p><br><p>What would be the fate of the captives?</p><br>',
