 <P>W&ocirc;banaki people did not have special clothing for sleeping. They slept in what seemed most suited for the season. In the winter this would mean wearing several layers to bed and in the hot weather one might sleep without clothing. </P> <p>W&ocirc;banaki people believed it was a good idea to protect sensitive areas of the body, such as joints, the neck, ears and face, with jewelry, garters, and tattoos. By these means, they believed that dangerous energy or spirits could not enter their bodies. Jewelry with complicated patterns, reflective surfaces, and dangling and jangling pieces such as bells or metal cones, all helped to confuse harmful forces. Porcupine quill embroidery, beading, fringe, and ribbons might be added to the edges of clothing, both to offer protection and to encourage connections with desirable plants and animals.. For instance, the hem of a skirt might be decorated with ribbon, or the flaps on a pair of moccasins might be decorated with beads or porcupine quill embroidery.</p> <p>Among the numerous items available through trade in the 1700s were wool and linen cloth, ready-made shirts and coats, knitted wool hats and mittens, glass beads, brass kettles, paint pigments such as vermillion, and metal axe and spear heads and knife blades. Native American people in New England would trade with the French in New France or the English in the American colonies. Items they received might come from England, France, Holland, or as far away as India.</p> <P><a href="../1700_wob_woman.html">Go to interactive Flash version</a></P> <p><img src="images/1700_wob_woman/layer-1.jpg" height="427" width="250" alt="model wearing deerskin dress" class="leftpad"></p> <h4>Dress</h4> <p>This dress is made of deerskin with painted designs.</p> <h4>Tattoos</h4> <p>Tattoos were put on the body for a variety of reasons.
