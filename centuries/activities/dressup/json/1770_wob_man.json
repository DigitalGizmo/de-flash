When a piece of flint is struck against a striker, sparks are produced that can be used to start a fire. If the lens is held at a certain angle to the sun, focusing the sun&rsquo;s rays onto something flammable such as a piece of tree fungus, it could generate enough heat to start a fire. On the right side, from top to bottom, are tobacco rolled up in paper, a screwdriver for use with a gun, a spring for cleaning a gun, and a stone pipe.",
