This woman might own several corsets that she might have made, but would more likely have purchased from a shop selling manufactured corsets.  Corsets in this period were most often white, off-white or a natural tan color.  Brightly colored corsets, such as the red one shown here, would have been remarkable at this time, but became popular in later decades.  The corset shown here has no shoulder straps and could therefore be worn with a ball gown as well as with day wear.  Some women who considered themselves quite stylish laced their corsets so tightly that they did harm to their bodies.  People were aware of the problems caused by doing this and most women laced their corsets snugly, but not to that extreme.",
