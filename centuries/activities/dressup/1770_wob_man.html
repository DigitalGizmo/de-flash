            <H1>W&ocirc;banaki Man's Clothing from 1770</H1>
            <P>By 1770, some W&ocirc;banaki people, especially those
              in French or English towns, were beginning to live in
              a manner very similar to that of the French and English.
              They often wore the same style of clothes, lived in the
              same kinds of houses, had many of the same types of possessions,
              and by outward appearance, did not appear to be dramatically
              different. Most Native people, however, kept some elements
              of tradition, by wearing moccasins and leggings, decorating
              their clothing with silver ornaments, or keeping their
              hair long. Some chose to keep traditional ways of life,
              and acquire just a few European items. Such is the case
              for the man described here, who wears a few items of
            clothing from the French Canadian people.</P>
            <p>W&ocirc;banaki people did not have special clothing
              for sleeping. They would sleep in what seemed most suited
              for the season. In the winter this would mean wearing
              several layers to bed and in the hot weather one might
              sleep without clothing.</p>
            <p>Hairstyles differed from group to group. In general,
              men living further north tended to keep their hair longer
              because the climate was cooler. Hairstyles would also
              change over the course of one&rsquo;s life to reflect
              personal taste, or to signify alliance or mourning.</p>
            <p>W&ocirc;banaki people believed it was a good idea to
              protect sensitive areas of the body, such as joints,
              the neck, ears and face, with jewelry, garters, and tattoos.
              By these means, they believed that dangerous energy or
              spirits could not enter their bodies. Jewelry with complicated
              patterns, reflective surfaces, and dangling and jangling
              pieces such as bells or metal cones, all helped to confuse
              harmful forces. Porcupine quill embroidery, beading,
              fringe, and ribbons might be added to the edges of clothing,
              both to offer protection and to encourage connections
              with desirable plants and animals. For instance, the
              edge of a breechclout might be decorated with ribbons,
              or the flaps on a pair of moccasins might be decorated
              with beads or porcupine quill embroidery.</p>
            <p>Among the numerous items available through trade in
              the 1770s were wool and linen cloth, ready-made shirts
              and coats, knitted wool hats and mittens, felted wool
              hats, glass beads, silver jewelry, brass kettles, paint
              pigments such as vermillion, and metal axe and spear
              heads and knife blades. Native American people in New
              England would trade with the French in New France or
              the English in the American colonies. Items they received
              might come from England, France, Holland, or as far away
              as India. or China.</p>
